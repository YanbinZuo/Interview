### Tomcat
Apache Tomcat, often referred to as Tomcat Server, is an open-source Java Servlet Container developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Tomcat implements several Java EE specifications including Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java EL, and WebSocket, and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment in which Java code can run.
•	RPC(Remote Procedure Call): a function call to a remote server. 
•	Java Servlet: Java class to handle RPC on server side.
•	Tomcat is an environment to run your web service, it provides low level support such as making TCP connection, receiving request from client, finding the correct service to handle that request, and sending response back.
•	If you want to create a web service based on Tomcat Server, all you need to do is implement the logic to handle certain HTTP request.
